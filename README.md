SEQUENTIAL NUMBER:
This code implements a function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to a given limit in chunks of a specified size. It uses asynchronous processing with setImmediate to avoid blocking the event loop, allowing efficient handling of large computations.

Code Explanation

Function: calculateChunkSum

Parameters:
1 limit (Number): The upper bound of the range of numbers to sum (inclusive).
2. size (Number): The size of the chunks used for summing.
3. callback (Function): A function to handle the sum of each chunk.

Description:
1. A variable number keeps track of the current number being processed.
2. The inner function calculateChunk:
3. Iteratively calculates the sum of numbers in a chunk of size size or until number exceeds limit.
4. Invokes the callback function with the chunk sum.
5. Schedules itself with setImmediate to process the next chunk until all numbers up to limit are processed.

Usage Example

Global Variables:
totalSum: Stores the cumulative sum of all chunks.

Execution:
1. Calls calculateChunkSum with:
2. limit: 1000000000
3. size: 1000000000
4. callback: A function to add the chunk sum to totalSum.
5. After computation, setImmediate schedules a console.log statement to display the total sum.

Key Functions:
1. setImmediate: Ensures asynchronous scheduling to prevent blocking the event loop during heavy computation.
2. callback: Enables flexible handling of each chunk's result, allowing accumulation or further processing.

Performance Considerations:
1. This approach avoids stack overflow or event loop blockage for large computations by chunking and asynchronously scheduling processing.
2. Depending on the runtime environment, the maximum chunk size (size) may affect performance. Adjust accordingly for optimal results.


CORE:
OS Module Example:
This project demonstrates how to use the Node.js os module to gather basic information about the operating system and CPU. The script provides details such as the OS platform, system architecture, and the number of CPU cores.

Breakdown of the Functions Used:
os.platform():
1. Returns a string identifying the platform of the operating system.
2. Example output: win32, linux, darwin.

os.arch():
1. Returns a string specifying the CPU architecture.
2. Example output: x64, arm, ia32.

os.cpus():
1. Returns an array of objects containing information about each CPU/core.
2. The .length property gives the total number of cores.

Usage:
1. Save the code to a file, e.g., osInfo.js.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   . node osInfo.js
4. The output will display:
 . The platform of the OS
 . The architecture of the system
 . The number of CPU cores
